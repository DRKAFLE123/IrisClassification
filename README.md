Iris_multiclass_Classification using Machine Learning algorithmsw
# Iam using the data set from kaggle which has following 4 features 
- sepal_length
- sepal_width
- petal_length
- petal_width
- and species as a categorical data
- The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper . The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.



# Iam using different ML algorithm to do classification of different 3 species[Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor] based on given 4 features.
# Algrothims
- LogisticRegression
- DecisionTRee
- SVM
- KNN

  # I have done analysis before developing the model for features selection as well as I have compared  the accuracy_score of all algorithms at last.
  # I find KNN as a Best for my iris_dataset
